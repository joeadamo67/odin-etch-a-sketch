# Etch-A-Sketch: A Browser-based Drawing App

## Overview

Welcome to Etch-A-Sketch, an interactive, browser-based drawing application! With a highly flexible canvas and multiple drawing modes, this app brings the fun and creativity of the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy into the digital realm.

Inspired by the retro toy, this application lets you create a wide variety of pixel art designs. It features a grid-based drawing surface that you can customize to your preference, alongside three different color modes: Black & White, Rainbow, and Pencil.

## Features

### Dynamic Board Creation

You're not restricted to a fixed canvas size! Click the "Create a new grid!" button and input your desired grid size (between 1-99) to generate a canvas tailored to your needs.

### Drawing Modes

Choose from three unique drawing modes to bring your digital artwork to life:

1. **Black & White**: Classic and straightforward, this mode colors the grid squares black upon clicking or dragging over them.
2. **Rainbow**: Get colorful! This mode assigns a random color to each grid square you interact with, producing vibrant, multi-colored designs.
3. **Pencil Mode**: Create gradients and add depth with this mode. Each interaction with a grid square darkens its color, mimicking the effect of going over a spot with a pencil.

### Grid Reset

Made a mistake or want to start a new design? Just hit the "Reset!" button to clear your canvas and let your creativity flow once again.

## Technologies Used

This project leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and interactive drawing experience in the browser. The app's design revolves around DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript, with the page layout and design handled by HTML and CSS.

## How to Run

As a purely front-end project, running Etch-A-Sketch is straightforward:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

And voila! You're ready to sketch!

## Potential Improvements

This project is a fun exercise in front-end development, but there's always room for enhancement:

- Performance: The application's performance can degrade with larger grid sizes due to the number of elements and event listeners. Further optimization could improve this.
- User Interface: The interface could be enhanced with more visual cues and better separation of controls.
- Mobile Responsiveness: Adapting the application for mobile devices and different screen sizes would be a valuable addition.

Feel free to fork this project and add your own improvements!

## Conclusion

Etch-A-Sketch is a fun, interactive drawing application that highlights the power of front-end technologies. Whether you want to create pixel art or just have fun, Etch-A-Sketch offers an engaging way to pass the time and exercise your creativity. Enjoy sketching!
